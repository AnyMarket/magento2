Description
---------
Hi! With ANYMARKET integration module properly installed and set up, the following automatic integrations will be possible:
- Products

Installation
----------
**Stay tuned on the tips that will help you succeed in your installation**

Minimum requirements
------------------
- [Magento] 2.x.x (as described in the versions in the table above)
- The server must have a processing capacity in a way that it won't be affected by the website and other integrations. Our integration works with the

  - The Default timeout is 20.000 ms, the operation is cancelled beyond that, which might result on updates errors between the platforms;
